Just don't. Absolutely no reasons [to make your software illegal](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/german-court-rules-websites-embedding.html). Spend 10 minutes to install npm deps instead.

```diff
- @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat');
- @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Code+Pro'); // Source Code Pro font
+ @import '@fontsource/montserrat/latin-400.css';
+ @import '@fontsource/source-code-pro/latin-400.css';
