# The list of US services and good I use (+ alternatives)

This list is created to keep track of the US dependencies I use. 

Ideally, there should be 0. It does seem really challenging, but not impossible.

### GitHub

### MacBook

- Good Alternatives: Lenovo ThinkPad + Linux (is Linux Mint still good for me as it was in good old days?)

### iPhone

### DigitalOcean

### Cloudflare

### Stripe

### Gmail

### Google Analytics

> Google Analytics is installed on and is tracking website traffic on 85% of all websites.
> A majority of web traffic is tracked by a single company.
> And that one company is also the largest advertising company in the world.
> What could possibly go wrong?
